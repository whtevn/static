a plan of action:

1. process a marked html page into a content, structure, and layout file

a. define methods of describing content and structure
  
  content and structure should be called out using "metamarkup" inside html comments.

  html comments should be disturbed by this as little as possible.

  deliniating content and structure should be easy, readable, and similar to one another

#### TEMPORARY SYNTAX ####

  <!--%% use_as(:main, :section) -->
  <!-- end main section %%-->

  <!--%% use_as(main, :section) %%-->

  <!--%% use_as(:main, :section) -->
  <!--%%-->


  first argument: name
  second argument: type (section, partial, content)
  third argument: splat of whatever the second argument requires. e.g. partial may need a path

  comments must be on their own lines, as the entirety of the comment lines containing %% until the
  next %% in an html comment (including on this line) will be entirely removed and replaced with a
  print statement in one file and made into another file or entry in a file somewhere else.


  use_as vs. use

  when generating the parts of multiple blueprint, sometimes partials may
  be duplicated. In order to accomodate a single partial being used as the
  master, "use" will _not_ print the contents into another file and will
  instead only issue a "print" statement and will assume that the appropriate
  partial will have been created by something else by the time static
  generation occurs.

b. define process for separating layout, content, and structure

  1. remove partials
    a. print in a "partials" file in an appropriate place
    b. replace with some sort of "print" statement
    c. recursively run the blueprint processing on the created partial
  2. remove sections
    a. print in "structure" file in an appropriate place
    b. replace with "print" statement
    c. recursively run blueprint processing on created section
  3. remove content
    a. print in "content" file in an appropriate place
    b. replace with "print" statement
  4. print remainder as layout


      --- or ---

  1. find first "use_as" statment
  2. remove until corresponding "end" statment, replace with print, and print contents somewhere else
  3. repeat











2. process a content, structure, and layout file into an html page

3. walk a site map / blueprint files and generate a project structure

4. walk a site map / layout,structure,content files and generate a static site

5. process a marked html page with feed instructions
