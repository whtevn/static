Q. How is this document going to be processed?

A. Most importantly, it will be processed alongside a site map.
   Because all of the pages in the site map will be generated via
   the base layout, I believe the best way to proceed is to load
   the base layout into a set of directives to be performed for
   each page given.

Q. What needs to be done with it?

A. It needs to be made into a "directive set".

   A DirectiveSet object consists of a "layout", which is a full-text
   copy of what it was given to work with, and "siblings", which is a 
   list of the "top-level" directives contained within the layout.

   It should also have the capability to produce a "result", which is
   the layout once its top-level directives have been executed.

Q. How are directives going to be executed?

A. MetaMark.execute(layout, *directives) should print files (if neceessary)
   and return the layout result against the directives.
